# paradoxical-poem-generator
A "very" naive poem generation.


## Dependencies
All you need is python3, and that's it. 


## What's With The Repo?
Oh yeah! My intention is to generate new texts/poems/lines based on my own poems as source.
The texts are generated using [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).
I have done a naive implementation of the Markov Chain using [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure 
using python dictionaries.


## Yosh! How Can I Use It?
All you've gotta do is trust on the script `markov.py` for now. That way the world will not explode.

```bash
python3 markov.py 10
```

This generates 10 lines of poem.


## Interesting, Heh?
Of course! It's interesting to see a machine generating poems, right?  
Yes. Let your fear take control of your mind. Machines will replace you.  
**coughs**  
Well! Fuck this shit! That's your fear. Machines aren't going anywhere with these cool stuff.

If you want to know the actual AI, see my presentation here on [Debunking AI](http://www.nishanpantha.com.np/debunking-ai/)

Yeah! Markov Chains are pretty handy tools. You can pretty much do anything. Cheers...
