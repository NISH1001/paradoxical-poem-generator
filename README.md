# paradoxical-poem-generator
A "very" naive poem generation.


## Dependencies
All you need is python3, and that's it. 


## What's With The Repo?
Oh yeah! My intention is to generate new texts/poems/lines based on my own poems as source.
The texts are generated using [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).
I have done a naive implementation of the Markov Chain using [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure 
using python dictionaries.
