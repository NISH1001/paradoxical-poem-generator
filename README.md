# paradoxical-poem-generator
A "very" naive poem generation.


## Dependencies
All you need is python3, and that's it. 


## What's With The Repo?
Oh yeah! My intention is to generate new texts/poems/lines based on my own poems as source.
The texts are generated using [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).
I have done a naive implementation of the Markov Chain using [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure 
using python dictionaries.


## Yosh! How Can I Use It?
All you've gotta do is trust on the script `markov.py` for now. That way the world will not explode.

```bash
python3 markov.py 10
```

This generates 10 lines of poem.

### Sample 1
```bash
There's something at the edge of a kind
'Tak Tak' — the sound of time
Where my soul wait to be stumbled by the “one”.
I know it. I have seen.
And I am no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
Each piece tries to bring on an Armageddon
Sometimes a little blue
As the time change
Floating right above where I live
That is what they serve in the distance
```

### Sample 2
`python3 markov.py 6`


```bash
The unknowns and the dead
Tomorrow. In the world is blind
As I watch the time walks.
Your eyes pop out of sight
Chhhh…. One moment you see me. You cannot see me. You cannot know me.
The heart isn't the only thing that matters
```


## Interesting, Heh?
Of course! It's interesting to see a machine generating poems, right?  
Yes. Let your fear take control of your mind. Machines will replace you.  
**coughs**  
Well! Fuck this shit! That's your fear. Machines aren't going anywhere with these cool stuff.

If you want to know the actual AI, see my presentation here on [Debunking AI](http://www.nishanpantha.com.np/debunking-ai/)

Yeah! Markov Chains are pretty handy tools. You can pretty much do anything. Cheers...
