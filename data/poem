Tonight! I am not sad.

Nor I am mad.

I am expressionless.

There’s nothing I have to express.

There’s no desire at expense.

Tonight! I am a commoner.

A Son — whose heart beats for his mother.

A Child — dreams all stout

A Brother — sister’s hopes echo aloud

A Neighbour — lively yet mysterious

A Citizen — responsible, inglorious

A no one — lurking in the shadow

Tonight! I am a friend

A faceless in the circle

Independent — lost in thoughts

Of love, life and arts

Some reasons to live

None clinging to another’s dream

Tonight! I am a pedestrian

Wandering around, feeling the rain

A Walker — indifferent yet significant

A Watcher —looking beyond the blurred lens

A Thinker — lost in dreams

Of silence and screams.

A Painter — filling the imagination

With life and thoughts

Still, I am no one rushing around.

Tonight — It’s special.

I’m on a date — with Peace and Chaos

No emotions — I am expressionless

Tonight! I am in search of myself.

A someone — a face under the mask

A traveller through time

A wanderer through life.

A stargazer — in awe of vastness

Of life and emptiness.

Here I am, sitting and watching
As I peek into the time ticking
All that is gone has never been
All that has gone is never seen
And the plot is on with this hum
And I know I will be gone…..
In this wicked land of make-believe
Is it only about me?
Are my thoughts cheap?
Am I trapped in an eternity of condemnation?
Or just a self-exposed contradiction?
The paradoxes of thoughts?
Or the thoughts of a paradox?
Yes,
I guess I am a paradox.
Paradox is me.

All I can do is watch and sit
Dunno where I’m going, what it’ll be
As if the wickedness inside
Has the audacity to defy it
To defy the salvation beneath
Where my soul wait to be bleached
And all I can do is…
Just watch and sit…
Just watch and sit…

Yes! My friend!
Or should I call you a FOE?
You are me and I am you
Both entangled in an oddly shaped world,
Wandering thoughtlessly like a zombie
Inside the world where you and I collide.
Where we grind
Our hopes, our dreams
In the place of make-believe.
And yes!
I have brought it upon me
Where we aren’t set free
Yes, my friend
You are right
You are me and I am you

With the mockery in the thoughts
And the heavy inertial plots
It is my shadow lurking beneath
As I watch the time ticking
My shadow stands there
Peeking. Searching. Wanting.
With stealth vision of slaughter
A deep conscious murder
My thoughts and my shadow conflict
Here and now, there and then
These are inside me
And I am inside them
What is this world?
Where is my place?
I stand — lost in thoughts
I am lost — in the mist of life

Running. Hiding.
Hush…

There comes a sudden whisper
A loud breeze passing by
There comes the sound
Wimpering
Ahhhh….
The lingering sound of silence.
The panicking sound of my own shadow.
Yes, you are right
I cant hide…

Is there any place to hide?
Or is it my illusion
To be bounded here
Trying to be free
With an absolute state of mind
Falling into a bottomless pit
Into a never-ending cycle of hope and despair.
In the world where time mocks you.
In this world shaped like a doughnut.
Where you and I meet.
Where me and my shadow reside.
Trapped inside each other.
My shadow feeds needlessly upon the darkness
Like cannibals hunting down their own kind.
My thoughts sip through my mind
Like a parasite eating me from inside.
As darkness dances in its eternal glory
My life pulsates, radiates into the unknown
Like a water leaking through the cracks
Unknown of its shape.

Sssh…
Remain silent.
Can you hear it?
Ssssh…
Can you hear it?
Just listen to it…
Sssh…
That’s the sound of time passing by.
Remain silent.
And enjoy the rhythms of life.

Finally, I can hide.
The shadow is gone.
The sound is no more.
And the ending is seamless.

Now I know.
Oh my thoughts.
Oh my vision.
Oh my dream.
You are all my FRIEND
You are all my FOE


Lying. Breathing.
Surmounted in a vicious cycle
Trapped. Breaking free.
And again chained and trapped.
The world asks me
Who I am
I can’t answer that.
I guess…

I am still struggling to define me.
I don’t know what kind of being I am.
Or am I even a being?

Sometimes as I lie around in the mist of chaos
I think myself as a “Brick”.
Let alone, I might not be so significant.
But together with other bricks, I will definitely fit in to a never-ending stairs of dreams.
Oh, wait! I am just another brick in the wall.
Out of shape. Jagged and Cracked. May or may not fit well with other.
Yup.
I might be “that” brick people throw around.
Protests. Fights. Dead loads.
I might as well blend in as a piece of shit.

But again. What do you think I am?
I can’t answer that.

I guess…
I am a cockroach.
A little creature that has tendency to give creeps 
To the beautiful among beautiful, brave among braves.
A little pest — dancing in the darkness
To be enchanted by the humanly screams.

Chhhh…. One moment you see me. Another moment, I vanish into the void.

Most of the time, I lash out in fear.
Fear of being stepped upon by my own thoughts.
Fear of being suffocated by the chains of reality.
Suffocation is real.
I suffocate from my own breathe that seems to sway even in the absence of beats.
Fear of being stamped — By the exoskeleton of false identity I wear.
This suit. It is heavy. And I fear.
I fear of being crumbled by this exoskeleton I shed every now and then.
I fear of me undergoing metamorphosis time and again.

And every time I emerge, I still feel I am that same old cockroach that had the Identity Crisis

But again. What do you think I am?
Can you tell who I am?
I am in a crisis here.
I can’t answer that.

Perhaps. I am a piece of “Stone” on the road.
I have seen people pass by.
Lovers. Haters. Parents. Children.
Narcissist. Introverts. Extroverts.
Different kinds of beings I have seen.

And I am standing there on the road. All by myself. As stealth as any piece of stone can be.

Waiting to be stumbled by the “one”.
Waiting for someone to get tipped.
Waiting. Waiting. Waiting…
Withstanding rains — each drop falling upon me like a missile from an unknown time
Forging my identity like a blacksmith whose identity you never know.

For I am just Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
Withstanding sun — the sun mocks my pride for it cannot move me from where I am lying.

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
Withstanding the wind — for it cannot erode away this uncanny masks of detachment. solitude

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
I am lying there on the road. All by myself. As stealth as any piece of stone can be.

Yet. You cannot see me. You cannot know me.
For I can’t really tell who I am.
Can you tell who I am?
I am in a crisis here.
I can’t seem to find me.

Perhaps…
I am no one, I am them.
I am “he”, I scream.
I am nature, I am free
I am time, I am space.
I am a figment of your imagination
I am a canvas where you paint your thoughts of freedom
Where each stroke of dots is a whole world in itself.
Like a black hole that is pulling all that is in existence. All that will never be.
Boundless your visions are. But you cannot really know me.

For I am a “question” that you will never find an answer to.


What is a hell?
The tolling of the bell?
Or is it just a reality
That’s been trolled?
An impose one
Deep beneath is none…?

What is a truth?
The lies through the tooth?
Or just an imposed shit
That you just bit…?

The very imposed words,
Stabbing every minds
Nothing seems real
Yet you can steal
Into the unknowns,
The you, THE HUMANS
They impose
They lose
None is the one,
Never is the world,
None shall speak
The genuine truth
Behind all the truths

It’s an imposed one
They impose
You impose
I impose
They lose
You lose
I lose
THE HUMANLY FOOLS…


Hey! Love.

Where are you?

Are you still in your mother’s womb?

Or taking a nap on her lap?

What are you doing?

Are you playing with your father?

Or is he watching your first stutter?

Where are you, really? Oh dear, Love.

I know you are right here.

Or perhaps, down the street. Right there.

Helping that old lady cross the road.

Or giving to the homeless, your old clothes

Are you in your friend’s house doing homeworks?

Or just having chit chat about your crush.

Are you in the streets playing with your friends?

Or making love with yourself watching the porns?

Where are you, really?

I am desperate to know.

Oh dear Love!

I know you are around.

Pranking with your sister.

Or playing video games with your brother.

I know you are around.

Where are you?

Are you playing in that puddle of mud?

Or teasing that dog down the street?

I know it. I have seen it.

You just stole those dollars for a candy or two.

Or perhaps, buying roses without any clue.

Oh love! Don’t be cruel.

Stop hitting your child without any reasons.

I know it hurts.

It saddens.

It pains.

But yes, Love! Hang in there.

Hope is alive and so are you.

Oh dear Love!

Don’t feel sad.

I know she has just passed away.

I don’t know the pain.

But that’s where you thrive.

Where you had felt alive.

Hang in there.

Keep on flourishing.

Oh dear Love!

I know that feeling

When you give vision to the visionless

Emotions to the emotionless

Life to the lifeless.

Hey Love! Just smile.

Smile is salvation.

Never stop it.

You are fit.

The world knows that.

Finally…

Dear Love!

I have found you.

I have reasons to live.

I salute you.

And yes.

I have gained courage to accept you.


Solitude

In the vastness of people

I seek redemption

Like an apparition.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

They think I am mental

I probably am a retard

Like a circus clown faking a laugh.

I probably am a freak

Like a specimen in a bio lab.

Perhaps I am a stranger

Walking on an unknown path.

Tap. Tap. Tap. As the time walks.

I crawl. Hush!

I crawl. They sprawl.

In the mist.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

I seek inner peace.

The blood rush has stalled.

May be the world is blind

Where I am just one of a kind

In an endless streaks

Of hopes and hopelessness

I am enduring time

Like a soldier on a field of mines

Looking for freedom.

Boom! The mind explodes.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost

The battle of a man. A boy. A child.

Solitude. Isolation. Silence.

The shadow lurks — “who goes there?”

Oh yes. That’s just me.

Seeking inner peace.

In solitude, I find myself.

In isolation, my mind thrives.

This is a battle of a man to be born from a child.

Boom! There goes another mine.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

Knock Knock!

“I am time.” — comes an unknown sound.

“I know no time.”, I reply.

The only time I know is the time that took my life.

For the time took my Emotions. Thoughts. My silent cry.

The time kept on knocking.

I kept on ignoring.

As they say ignorance is a bliss.

But the only bliss is a solitude.

It’s a fortitude.

It’s worth suffering for.

For I seek inner peace.

I seek salvation.

Not a cremation.

For I am the isolation you won’t seek.

I am the solitude you won’t find.

I am the silence you won’t hear.
