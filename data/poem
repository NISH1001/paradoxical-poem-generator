Tonight! I am not sad.

Nor I am mad.

I am expressionless.

There’s nothing I have to express.

There’s no desire at expense.

Tonight! I am a commoner.

A Son — whose heart beats for his mother.

A Child — dreams all stout

A Brother — sister’s hopes echo aloud

A Neighbour — lively yet mysterious

A Citizen — responsible, inglorious

A no one — lurking in the shadow

Tonight! I am a friend

A faceless in the circle

Independent — lost in thoughts

Of love, life and arts

Some reasons to live

None clinging to another’s dream

Tonight! I am a pedestrian

Wandering around, feeling the rain

A Walker — indifferent yet significant

A Watcher —looking beyond the blurred lens

A Thinker — lost in dreams

Of silence and screams.

A Painter — filling the imagination

With life and thoughts

Still, I am no one rushing around.

Tonight — It’s special.

I’m on a date — with Peace and Chaos

No emotions — I am expressionless

Tonight! I am in search of myself.

A someone — a face under the mask

A traveller through time

A wanderer through life.

A stargazer — in awe of vastness

Of life and emptiness.

Here I am, sitting and watching
As I peek into the time ticking
All that is gone has never been
All that has gone is never seen
And the plot is on with this hum
And I know I will be gone…..
In this wicked land of make-believe
Is it only about me?
Are my thoughts cheap?
Am I trapped in an eternity of condemnation?
Or just a self-exposed contradiction?
The paradoxes of thoughts?
Or the thoughts of a paradox?
Yes,
I guess I am a paradox.
Paradox is me.

All I can do is watch and sit
Dunno where I’m going, what it’ll be
As if the wickedness inside
Has the audacity to defy it
To defy the salvation beneath
Where my soul wait to be bleached
And all I can do is…
Just watch and sit…
Just watch and sit…

Yes! My friend!
Or should I call you a FOE?
You are me and I am you
Both entangled in an oddly shaped world,
Wandering thoughtlessly like a zombie
Inside the world where you and I collide.
Where we grind
Our hopes, our dreams
In the place of make-believe.
And yes!
I have brought it upon me
Where we aren’t set free
Yes, my friend
You are right
You are me and I am you

With the mockery in the thoughts
And the heavy inertial plots
It is my shadow lurking beneath
As I watch the time ticking
My shadow stands there
Peeking. Searching. Wanting.
With stealth vision of slaughter
A deep conscious murder
My thoughts and my shadow conflict
Here and now, there and then
These are inside me
And I am inside them
What is this world?
Where is my place?
I stand — lost in thoughts
I am lost — in the mist of life

Running. Hiding.
Hush…

There comes a sudden whisper
A loud breeze passing by
There comes the sound
Wimpering
Ahhhh….
The lingering sound of silence.
The panicking sound of my own shadow.
Yes, you are right
I cant hide…

Is there any place to hide?
Or is it my illusion
To be bounded here
Trying to be free
With an absolute state of mind
Falling into a bottomless pit
Into a never-ending cycle of hope and despair.
In the world where time mocks you.
In this world shaped like a doughnut.
Where you and I meet.
Where me and my shadow reside.
Trapped inside each other.
My shadow feeds needlessly upon the darkness
Like cannibals hunting down their own kind.
My thoughts sip through my mind
Like a parasite eating me from inside.
As darkness dances in its eternal glory
My life pulsates, radiates into the unknown
Like a water leaking through the cracks
Unknown of its shape.

Sssh…
Remain silent.
Can you hear it?
Ssssh…
Can you hear it?
Just listen to it…
Sssh…
That’s the sound of time passing by.
Remain silent.
And enjoy the rhythms of life.

Finally, I can hide.
The shadow is gone.
The sound is no more.
And the ending is seamless.

Now I know.
Oh my thoughts.
Oh my vision.
Oh my dream.
You are all my FRIEND
You are all my FOE


Lying. Breathing.
Surmounted in a vicious cycle
Trapped. Breaking free.
And again chained and trapped.
The world asks me
Who I am
I can’t answer that.
I guess…

I am still struggling to define me.
I don’t know what kind of being I am.
Or am I even a being?

Sometimes as I lie around in the mist of chaos
I think myself as a “Brick”.
Let alone, I might not be so significant.
But together with other bricks, I will definitely fit in to a never-ending stairs of dreams.
Oh, wait! I am just another brick in the wall.
Out of shape. Jagged and Cracked. May or may not fit well with other.
Yup.
I might be “that” brick people throw around.
Protests. Fights. Dead loads.
I might as well blend in as a piece of shit.

But again. What do you think I am?
I can’t answer that.

I guess…
I am a cockroach.
A little creature that has tendency to give creeps 
To the beautiful among beautiful, brave among braves.
A little pest — dancing in the darkness
To be enchanted by the humanly screams.

Chhhh…. One moment you see me. Another moment, I vanish into the void.

Most of the time, I lash out in fear.
Fear of being stepped upon by my own thoughts.
Fear of being suffocated by the chains of reality.
Suffocation is real.
I suffocate from my own breathe that seems to sway even in the absence of beats.
Fear of being stamped — By the exoskeleton of false identity I wear.
This suit. It is heavy. And I fear.
I fear of being crumbled by this exoskeleton I shed every now and then.
I fear of me undergoing metamorphosis time and again.

And every time I emerge, I still feel I am that same old cockroach that had the Identity Crisis

But again. What do you think I am?
Can you tell who I am?
I am in a crisis here.
I can’t answer that.

Perhaps. I am a piece of “Stone” on the road.
I have seen people pass by.
Lovers. Haters. Parents. Children.
Narcissist. Introverts. Extroverts.
Different kinds of beings I have seen.

And I am standing there on the road. All by myself. As stealth as any piece of stone can be.

Waiting to be stumbled by the “one”.
Waiting for someone to get tipped.
Waiting. Waiting. Waiting…
Withstanding rains — each drop falling upon me like a missile from an unknown time
Forging my identity like a blacksmith whose identity you never know.

For I am just Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
Withstanding sun — the sun mocks my pride for it cannot move me from where I am lying.

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
Withstanding the wind — for it cannot erode away this uncanny masks of detachment. solitude

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
I am lying there on the road. All by myself. As stealth as any piece of stone can be.

Yet. You cannot see me. You cannot know me.
For I can’t really tell who I am.
Can you tell who I am?
I am in a crisis here.
I can’t seem to find me.

Perhaps…
I am no one, I am them.
I am “he”, I scream.
I am nature, I am free
I am time, I am space.
I am a figment of your imagination
I am a canvas where you paint your thoughts of freedom
Where each stroke of dots is a whole world in itself.
Like a black hole that is pulling all that is in existence. All that will never be.
Boundless your visions are. But you cannot really know me.

For I am a “question” that you will never find an answer to.


What is a hell?
The tolling of the bell?
Or is it just a reality
That’s been trolled?
An impose one
Deep beneath is none…?

What is a truth?
The lies through the tooth?
Or just an imposed shit
That you just bit…?

The very imposed words,
Stabbing every minds
Nothing seems real
Yet you can steal
Into the unknowns,
The you, THE HUMANS
They impose
They lose
None is the one,
Never is the world,
None shall speak
The genuine truth
Behind all the truths

It’s an imposed one
They impose
You impose
I impose
They lose
You lose
I lose
THE HUMANLY FOOLS…


Hey! Love.

Where are you?

Are you still in your mother’s womb?

Or taking a nap on her lap?

What are you doing?

Are you playing with your father?

Or is he watching your first stutter?

Where are you, really? Oh dear, Love.

I know you are right here.

Or perhaps, down the street. Right there.

Helping that old lady cross the road.

Or giving to the homeless, your old clothes

Are you in your friend’s house doing homeworks?

Or just having chit chat about your crush.

Are you in the streets playing with your friends?

Or making love with yourself watching the porns?

Where are you, really?

I am desperate to know.

Oh dear Love!

I know you are around.

Pranking with your sister.

Or playing video games with your brother.

I know you are around.

Where are you?

Are you playing in that puddle of mud?

Or teasing that dog down the street?

I know it. I have seen it.

You just stole those dollars for a candy or two.

Or perhaps, buying roses without any clue.

Oh love! Don’t be cruel.

Stop hitting your child without any reasons.

I know it hurts.

It saddens.

It pains.

But yes, Love! Hang in there.

Hope is alive and so are you.

Oh dear Love!

Don’t feel sad.

I know she has just passed away.

I don’t know the pain.

But that’s where you thrive.

Where you had felt alive.

Hang in there.

Keep on flourishing.

Oh dear Love!

I know that feeling

When you give vision to the visionless

Emotions to the emotionless

Life to the lifeless.

Hey Love! Just smile.

Smile is salvation.

Never stop it.

You are fit.

The world knows that.

Finally…

Dear Love!

I have found you.

I have reasons to live.

I salute you.

And yes.

I have gained courage to accept you.


Solitude

In the vastness of people

I seek redemption

Like an apparition.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

They think I am mental

I probably am a retard

Like a circus clown faking a laugh.

I probably am a freak

Like a specimen in a bio lab.

Perhaps I am a stranger

Walking on an unknown path.

Tap. Tap. Tap. As the time walks.

I crawl. Hush!

I crawl. They sprawl.

In the mist.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

I seek inner peace.

The blood rush has stalled.

May be the world is blind

Where I am just one of a kind

In an endless streaks

Of hopes and hopelessness

I am enduring time

Like a soldier on a field of mines

Looking for freedom.

Boom! The mind explodes.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost

The battle of a man. A boy. A child.

Solitude. Isolation. Silence.

The shadow lurks — “who goes there?”

Oh yes. That’s just me.

Seeking inner peace.

In solitude, I find myself.

In isolation, my mind thrives.

This is a battle of a man to be born from a child.

Boom! There goes another mine.

Emotions. Thoughts. All lost.

Knock Knock!

“I am time.” — comes an unknown sound.

“I know no time.”, I reply.

The only time I know is the time that took my life.

For the time took my Emotions. Thoughts. My silent cry.

The time kept on knocking.

I kept on ignoring.

As they say ignorance is a bliss.

But the only bliss is a solitude.

It’s a fortitude.

It’s worth suffering for.

For I seek inner peace.

I seek salvation.

Not a cremation.

For I am the isolation you won’t seek.

I am the solitude you won’t find.

I am the silence you won’t hear.

Up the hill, you crawl
When the moon begins to fall
Blood in your eyes
The sky is a disguise
Your shadow holding on
To an invisible line
Ready to jump off the cliff
Your gazes are locked
Into the abyss
The darkness eating the stars
In an emptiness floating afar

Up the hill, you fall
When your fear rains down all
Somewhere your heart is trembling
In the space where clouds are crippling
Your mind wanders off
As the light flutters
In the distant skyline
Where your hopes diverge
As your skull unfolds
Gray scales of imagination evaporates
Your eyes pop out of the socket
As they oscillate back and forth 
Unsure on how to react
The darkness dives in
Then the emptiness circles everything

Down the hill, the shadow falls
Splash of the silence echoes

When I was a kid, I came to know that
The bullet-proof glass isn't bullet proof
Eventually it shatters
Like a heart that's been shattered into pieces.
Somebody once told me that
Each piece of shattered heart tries to form new love
Each piece tries to do the flirtation
Like your immune system coping with foreign viruses.
But mine started to do multi-tasking
With coffee on one side. Coding shit on the other.
And going on blind dates
Not giving a fuck about the world
I am where my mind operates.
Where my thoughts tolerates
The unknowns and the fantasies


When I was a teen, I came to know that
The heart isn't the only thing that shatters.
People get broken into pieces
By everything around
Like a bullet from AK-47
That tries to bring on an Armageddon
Upon your memory lane
That starts fire in your heart
In your freedom
In your actions
In your pain
My thoughts started to commit crime




When I was what I am now
I started believing in memories
In self-reliant thoughts
In self-condemning mental processes
Somewhere down the timeline
I was haunted by the zombies
Of time. Of self-regulatory mental traffic
Of self-destructible crimes
Of mind games
Of mindgasms
Of mind porn
Of people around
I realized that there are people
People that eats people
Like cannibals eating their own kind
I realized that heart isn't the only thing that matters
Our mind is a strange place
Where we are face to face
With the demons that make us
With the alter-egos that complete us
That compete with us
With the illusions that try to believe in us
Our mind is a strange place.



Now I am a timeless entity
A ghost of your imagination
I am figment of your thoughts
I am what what I was when I came to know that
The bullet-proof glass isn't bullet proof
Eventually it shatters
I am stuck in a loop of self-improvement
Of the distant past.
Of the abnormality
I am "when I will be"
I will be "when I was"
I was "when I am"
The demons that make us.


Sometimes high above the hill
Sometimes among the urban thrill
Sometimes right above where I live
Sometimes far away where the rivers leak
Sometimes sitting still under the lake
Sometimes rising above the plane
Sometimes fuming with black smokes
Sometimes doing a mysterious backstroke
Sometimes giving an elusive smile
Sometimes faking it to an overkill
Sometimes painted on the oily canvas
Sometimes reflecting back from old photographs
Sometimes driving down the memory lane
Sometimes acting as a drug to the pain
Sometimes floating into the unknowns
Sometimes wandering around the towns
Sometimes a little low kicking your ass
Sometimes a little high with a flash
Sometimes as big as a whale
Sometimes as tiny as a snail
Sometimes crying with heavy heart
Sometimes laughing with sunny side
Sometimes chasing me in a foreign land
Sometimes thunderstruck with a rock-and-roll band

Everything outside my mind
Everything out of my grasp
Floating right above the eyes
I can hear its loud cries
I know it is dead
Or just alive
Maybe it is a bread
Acting like a knife
Maybe it is a sword
Cutting a piece of paper
Maybe it is a ford
Racing with the vapor
That's all I know
That's all I know
When these thoughts flow
And it's right there within the echoes
Up in the spaces where I roam
Trying to fill in the void
Within my empty heart
That's all I know
About the mysterious flight of the undead...


Like a gentle breeze
She comes into my life
Touches my heart
And passes by

With freedom, she flies
Like a cloud
Kissing the sky
Only some know

She — an incantation of life
Where kindness thrives
Amid the strangers, I am not hers
She isn't mine

She resides in her own world
Of chains and freedom
Of chaos and wisdom
Of thoughts and confusion
Of hope and despair
Of innocence and care
Of growth and lives

She - a person to be around
Where conversations heal wound
Of life and dreams
Of silence and screams
Of past and the present
And days to come
Drowned in our own stops
I am not hers
She isn't mine

When she's around
I can be me
I can be me - a paradox
Whining..
About life
With silent cry
About dreams
Out of sight
About visions
With hopeless flight
About struggles
Noone cares
About voices
Tortured inside
About mischief
Echo aloud

Living on a strange world
With a mysterious smile
In a strange time
With an uncanny style
Funny and serious
Mindful and curious
That's all to what she is
This is not love
This is not hatred
This is beyond comprehension
An cosmic contemplation

Things flying around, here and there
What you're thinking isn't very clear
Walking down the rivers of fire
You can hear your silences

Floating clouds in the daylight
Fading stars in the night
Confusion in your mind
Love in your heart
Smells from your fart
Boobs on your chest
Emptiness in your eyes
Silences in your cries

Coffee date with your smile
Your mysterious existence in my mind


Waiting for you in your place
You stand there in a black dress
Walking down the same old street
Creating new memories
Talking shit create the mood
Feeling hungry eat the food
Hesitation to hold the hands
Listening to all your rants


Coffee date with your smile
Your mysterious existence in my mind
We ran out of money and time
I wish i were yours and you were mine!

These words I could not speak to you
They are a little happy, a little blue
Yeah love! Life is short, we will be dead
Let's create memories we will not forget

These are the things I stare at
Keep on rewinding my memory tape
These are the things I could not say
I keep on hoping they'll not fade away

These are the things I stare at
Keep on rewinding my memory tape
These are the things I could not say
I keep on hoping they'll not fade away

Memories are here to stay

The way she smiles
In a black dress
Like a shadow
Dancing in complete darkness
Peeking out of the window
To see the moonlight

The way she spreads her hair
In complete randomness
Like the tentacles from cuthulu
Trying to seduce you
Ripping your skin apart
To the lonely heart

The way she stares
When the iris harmonizes
To the demonic gazes
And you are swallowed 
In whole another dimension
Of morbid hallows

The way she talks
About emptiness
That makes up everything
The one that holds your existence
And you are submerged
Into a deep underwater
Canyons in a ghastly field
Your emotions get unsealed.

These dark secrets she hold
In her weird world
Of things that are too dark
Of maladies not so far
Of melodies that fail to spark
Of melancholy she wishes to depart

Her eyes
They preach
They reach
The vastness
Of cosmos
Of one's mind
Hidden in plain sight
Of Ephemeral moments
Of Ethereal experiences
Of darkest of nights
Of sadness in light
Of broken hearts
Of not giving a fuck
Of saying "life sucks"
In awe
Of stars
And the scars
Where an aurora surmounts
An aurora of her weird existence


It's cold In the morning
The sun Is dying
The sky Is crying
The cloud Is smoking
The dog Is sleeping
The bird Is silent
The street Is muddy
The bike Is shivering
The kid Is jumping


My eyes Are gazing
Out of the Broken window
My heart Is aching
As it is Thinking
My head Feels heavy
My mind Is lonely
The emotions Are flooding
The words Are freezing
My ears Are Listening
The thoughts Are echoing
Her memories Are lurking
To emptiness That's diving in
My sanity Is fading
The darkness Is coming
The songs Are mocking
The music Is saddening

It's cold Inside me
My heart's Pounding hurriedly
My anxieties Are growing
As her memories Hallucinate me

It's cold inside me
My breathe Is shortening
The coffee Is Evaporating
As her memories Intoxicate me

Today. Right now. In this moment
Piling up the  broken thoughts
Trying to make sense of this stasis
The clock ticks with existential crisis
The space between your two eyes
Wakes up with ignorance
Your mind tries to break free
From the empty electrolysis
Your gazes locked upon into the abyss
Like a dark soul 
Watching you
Alluring in for seduction


Today. Right now. In this moment
You try to feel your breath
As you breathe in the smokes
From the ticking time bomb
That has been detonated
From the fear of your life
Like a slow radiation poisoning
Destroying your hopes
Sinking your inner euphoria
To the swamp into the bliss
Your mind breaks down
Slowy.And Slowly. And Slowly.
From the electric current 
Circulating on the death chair
You are sitting right there
Without doing anything.
You've got nothing.

Today. Right now. In this  very moment.
As you walk into the unknowns
Hopelessness is what they serve in the menu
The cost is too high
For you to fly
You lay down silently
The clock has stopped ticking
The gravity has stopped working
The birds are falling down
The fishes have evaporated
The sun has become pale
The moon has gone dark
The earth has stopped its rotation
Like some type of demonic infection
Chopping up your body
Piece by Piece
Piece by Piece
Piece by Piece
Your heart aches
Not knowing how it has stopped beating
That is what they serve in the menu!

Tomorrow. In the Future.
When you wake up without your heart
When you have lost your eyes
When you have forgotten your sense of smell
When you are possessed by the curse
The eternity sleeps right beside you
Hugging you
Staring into your soul
Sucking up your blood
Like a dark love from a vampire
In an invisible attire
When the darkness within you surrenders
And the eternity is all you have
Surmounting for a ghastly sex
Her shadow gropes your neck
You lay there hopelessly
Every excitement sips off your life
As the clock starts ticking violently
As the world starts moving hurriedly
As the dead birds get resurrected
As the fishes rain down
Your existence vanishes slowly
For eternity
For she takes you far away
For she is the only thing that's real
You live for eternity
You die for eternity
For eternity
For eternity
And beyond

Cold in the scorching sun
She sits there silently
Letting her emotions burn
Like a domino toppling violently
In the world of make-believe
Where reality hits her hard
Thoughts disrupting the internal peace
In a wild wind, she's lost afar


He has a faceless expression
Sees her invisible to the world around
Unsure of the empty communication
Disrupted by the gasping sound
In the place of eternal solitude
He found her among the chaos
Ever-lasting changes that allude
The memories of her within a stasis


The night was ready.
The morning never was.
The sun drove to darkness
But the darkness wasn't there.
I waited patiently for the lights to go out.
But, the stars kept their shine, and hazed among the clouds...
The moon started to smile, and the night began to laugh
Floating above the hills, i saw my shadow in halft
Just as I kept staring the darkness within me
These empty feelings, they started to love me back

The night was ready.
The morning never was.
The sun drove to darkness
Finally, I found it right here

So much shit a man can tolerate
So much choices a man can relate
But death is what he waits
Like an exponential decay
Leaking out from a fray
Like a mold from a clay

So many things a man can avoid
So many lives a man can cloud
But death is what he waits
Like a hypnotized soul-reaper
Looking for a slayer
To the demons he can hear
Standing among the prayers

So little things a man did
So little life he lived
But death is his sin
Like an exponential decay

Sometimes...
Sometimes I feel my head is the sun
Where rest of the world revolves around
Too close, you get burn
Too far,  you get shunned
Somewhere, lies a Goldilocks region
The place of mindful creation
The place of self destruction

Sometimes my mind is a black hole
Where the voices never echo
Your images projected
Like a theory of holographic universe
But this time, it's the people and their curses
Their inner demons blessed with bruises
Of the battles fought within themselves
Egos and Modesty revolving selfishness
Like twin stars
Dancing with each other
Around a star
That has never let you escape
Spiraling around and around and around and around...
The harmony attenuates
To this lifeless part
The universal art!

Sometimes....It's amazing...
It's amazing to even be a black hole...
Thoughts come in and never escape
You try to accelerate and go full throttle
But there's no return
You try to boost with extra fantasies
With the escape velocity
You had never imagined existed
Like a timeless entity
Pulling you to its core
Beyond its event horizon
You are gone...
I guess you are gone in parts

Sometimes....
Sometimes I wish I were a supernova nearing its death
Where the explosion creates a surge of emotions
A sudden gamma burst
That inflicts philosophical wounds to your inner Bruce Baner
Where a new hulk is about to emerge.
But this time, he's calmer!

Sometimes... **Takes a long deep breath**

Sometimes I feel like an electron
All charged with these negative charges
Ready to electrocute the world around
All you have to do is let me flow
Let my inner demons burn and glow!

Sometimes I feel like a gluon
A strong force
That helds conflicting thoughts together
Like protons and neutrons in the same cage
Giving each other a part of their support
Unaware of their own purpose!
The inner quarks
Quack
Silently
with emptiness...

Sometimes...
Sometimes among the POWERS OF TEN
I feel like a binary switch turning ON and OFF
The parts of which doesn't make sense
The whole creates essence with its presence!
The world is empowered!

Sometimes I wish I was as hypothetical as Deep Thought can be
Where hitchhikers around the galaxy come and ask
"Hey! What's the meaning of YOUR LIFE, YOUR UNIVERSE AND YOUR EVERYTHING"
And I compute there silently and reply back
"ZERO DIVIDED BY INFINITY"
Because I am not sure what my limits are...

At other times I feel like an incompleteness theorem
Lurking around, here and there in forums
Of Reddit, Stackexchange, Quora
And YouTube comments
Nobody gets it
But everyone enjoys the existential crisis
Of axioms and logic


But often...
Often I feel like a tree in the forest
The world of eternal solitude
A tree
That is about to fall
Or has fallen
The echo of which you will never hear...
I ask a question to the universe:
"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

The universe sits silently
Staring at me
Right through my soul
Gives me a silent gaze 
Doesn’t reply back 
Everything crumbles to nothingness 
Like it was before 
Can you hear?

Volt up your emotion, before you lose your notion
Charge up your spirit, before you slow down in the motion
Set up your potential high, for the fastest overwhelming move on
And be prepared with the tension in your soul for what about to happen

You'll confuse yourself when you'll enter the phase
Keep up your pace when you'll see the time change
Hold your heart tight, here come's the huge fight
HIGH-volt age will consume you and you wont see the light

Don't give up the pace, you have to win the game
Else the high volt time will put your name to shame
Like the shattered glass it just breaks your pride
And you'll find yourself in a place you cant hide

My life has turned the way I don't want
The time has pierced me right through my heart
My life has felt the regret in that game
All that time I was pacing up for the doom fame

It all began when I stepped in for that game
Trying to control all the way of time
All the way I'd tried to manipulate the future
But now what I've got left is a fate rupture
(and the HIGH volt memory torture)

Don't pace up for the broken pride, you have to give up
The race of time has become rough and tough
The tracks are all overcharged with the high volt
And there's nothing left for the future and past to bolt

The memories that give you a high volt shock
You have to forget 'em all, and restart your luck
There's no time left for you to withstand it
When the high volt impulse in your nerve collapse to beat

A high volt spark of little hope evolves to die
And you cry and cry and cry....

Run away...Run...
You cant tolerate it...
Run away...Run...
You cant tolerate it...
Run away...
You cant tolerate...

THE HIGH VOLTAGE GAME OF TIME....

I want to soar so high
Where no one can dare fly
I want to get so low
Where no one can ease below
There's something inside me
That which i cant see
There's something at the core
Watch me go wild and roar....

Watch me if you can see me do a pulsate
As if It's some sort of like a nauseate


Walking on the narrows streets of Patan
With the silent whispers from the Satan
Aimless steps under scorching sun 
Monuments and arts and creation
People moving here and there
Like a battle-station

An existence frozen in time.
An existence fading out of time.
Listening to the beats from the headphone
Dum. Da-dum. Dum. Dum. 
"Master of puppets" feeds the rhythms
Eating "Erotic Cakes" from Guthrie Govan
Guitar strings. And glares. And and motions
The guitar solos flow with pentatonics
And suddenly I am cursed with Opeth
Stuck. I am stuck.
Mind's getting off the tracks.
"Polyphia" is on the track
Plays "Crush".
I am lost.

Walking with short-burst breathe.
As if the lungs are in haste
With overdose from the air I kiss.
People moving here and there.
Like markets with fish
Where "work" is the fishing net
And "relationship" is just a click-bait
With life getting hooked to death
Walking with the rhythms from the music
I gasp to correct my mind.
But. But. But.
There's no hope.

Walking and gazing and getting lost.
High hopes are curated.
Eternity is a known entity here.
I drift silently.
Eyeing at that girl alone
Trying to not make it awkward.
A little boner.
But not a failure!
We pass by with silences.
The headphone shuts down.
Without any reasons.
I give a silent gaze.
Like "Buckhethead" on the stage.
And. And. And.
That's it.

There's another time.
Walking on the narrows streets of Patan
Loud whispers from Dave Mustaine.
With a friend behind.
Somewhere a girl gets spawn.
Like a NPC from our favorite video game
We stop. I am shot.
She captured me.



Every pixel you can touch
Your existence is yellow
Try saturating the color blue
I wonder where are you

The sky was dark and bold
There was no color red
The sun had been shot and killed
With the colors you had filled


The photograph will fade
No ashes will be left
The pixel you had touched
Will be corrupted


Eternal Slumber!
A Comfort disorder
Therein lies
Beautiful chaos.
A slipping reality
In the silent cry
Condemned. Provoked.
Forgotten solace.
A forced salvation
A mental recorder
Wherein crawls
Forging illusions

Hallucinations and tunes
Of disdain and static and pain
Random actions
Without any plans
An Infinite search
For darkness
That tame

Hopeless thoughts
A Rising crisis
Therein tempts
Fearful existence
A shimmering hope
In the vanishing light
Chained. Haunted.
Visions are blooded.
Minds exploded
Everything's out of sight

From the darkness in the distance
A man emerges
All painted in black.
He crawls upon the land
Screaming. Serenading…
Perched at the edge of a shallow dream.

He sings the song of death.
He tames the fate.
Lurking in the shadow
“Tap! Tap! Tap” 
He crawls. He walks.

He doesn't breathe.
Yet, his whispers can be heard.
His eyes. He has none.
They are hollow.
Yet, they are pretty.
His gazes are red
Like a fire burning inside.
He crawls. He walks.

His feet. They are not

Walking — calmly and slowly
Letting go of all the hustle
Aimlessly kissing
The time and the street beneath
Where lies pain and misery
Of life among the history
A step I take
'Tak Tak' — the sound of the city
I see people lurking
With greed and lust
Where hopes are crushed
Behind the mask of trust


As the gentle breeze passes by
All I can hear is “money”
Where life rumbles in agony
Not of suffering
But the voices — all suppressed
And “People” inside a soul-less thing
With all the corruption
Within the lifeless emotions
Some lives living
Some starting to live
Some struggling and stumbling


As I wander, often
Something follows me behind
Not a shadow but a timeless being
Among the silent noises
That fill the streets
With hopes and despair
With trust and care
With living and the dead
With “rights” and rituals
With face and curious minds


Walking, running, crawling
As I feel the screams
Of survival dreams
On these streets
Where people laugh
And hatred thrives
Where poor nap
A child without mother’s lap
Where children play
And diseased lay
Where money talks
With the curse
Of a soul
Living in fear


As I wake up 
On the streets
Where darkness
Upholds the light
Life speaks
Time lies
Patience falls
Endurance poisons
The streets beneath
Haunted by me
